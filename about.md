# Code for America Hurricane Response Theme

This is a Jekyll theme for quickly deploying map sites with the [shelter-api](https://github.com/hurricane-response/florence-api).

In a response the *focus* **should not be** on the ***tech***.

If you would like to contribute to this project, we have [open issues](https://github.com/hurricane-response/response-theme/issues) we welcome feedback and pull requests on.

You can also make tax-deductible [donations to Code for America](https://www.codeforamerica.org/donate)
